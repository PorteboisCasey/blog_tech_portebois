# How I Optimize My Time Between School, Work, and Master's Applications 🎯

Ever felt like your life is a high-stakes juggling act? Well, that's my current reality, balancing what some might call an ambitious trio of challenges:

- Intensive coursework and school projects 📚
- A critical year-end project at my work-study program 💼
- Master's program research and applications 🎓

Here's how I'm managing it all without losing my mind (or my love for coding).

## The Triple Challenge 🎮

My daily life revolves around three major challenges:

- **School**: Technical projects, exams, and continuous deadlines
- **Work-Study**: A major project due by year's end
- **Master's Search**: Identifying and preparing applications for the right program

## My Organization Strategy 📋

I've developed what I call the "TriForce" system to manage these three aspects:

### Essential Tools ⚡

- **Notion**: My second brain for centralizing everything
- **Google Calendar**: Precise planning with color coding
- **Trello**: Task and project tracking
- **Microsoft To Do**: For daily tasks

## School: Maximizing Learning 📚

School requires particular organization, especially with group projects and exams:

### Key Strategies

1. **Weekly Planning**: Optimized study sessions
2. **Early Preparation**: Anticipating major projects
3. **Collaboration**: Effective group work methods

## Work-Study: DevOps Engineering in Action 💼

My main project at work? Implementing a robust CI/CD pipeline on Rocky Linux. A technical challenge that requires both precision and creativity.

### Surgical Time Management ⚡

- **6:30-7:00 AM**: Planning and goals review
- **7:00-11:30 AM**: Deep work on pipeline and scripts
- **11:30-12:00 PM**: Documentation and commits
- **1:30-3:30 PM**: Code reviews and optimizations
- **3:30-4:30 PM**: Testing and monitoring
- **4:30-5:00 PM**: Next day preparation

### DevOps Methodology

1. **Weekly Planning**
   - SMART objectives set every Monday
   - Technical KPIs tracked daily
   - Friday retrospectives

2. **Systematic Documentation**
   - Technical wiki constantly updated
   - Crucial process flowcharts
   - Future maintainers' guides

3. **Continuous Optimization**
   - Repetitive tasks automation
   - Custom monitoring scripts
   - Real-time performance metrics

### Mastered Technical Stack

- **Infrastructure**: Rocky Linux, Docker, Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
- **Scripting**: Python, Bash, PowerShell

The key? Military-grade organization combined with a modern DevOps approach. Every minute counts, every action is deliberate, every decision is documented.

## A Mysterious Personal Project 🤫

Between these challenges, I'm also developing something exciting... Without revealing too much (full video coming soon), imagine:

- Cutting-edge technologies
- Artificial intelligence
- A concept that could be a game-changer...

More revelations in an upcoming video! 😉

## Master's Search: A Methodical Approach 📝

For finding the ideal Master's program, I've developed a structured approach:

### My Methodology

1. **Program Analysis**:
   - Detailed curriculum comparison
   - Specialization evaluation
   - Career prospects study

2. **Time Organization**:
   - Dedicated research slots
   - Important dates tracking
   - Progressive application preparation

## Smart Time Management 🤖

I optimize my schedule by:

- Identifying peak productivity slots
- Automating repetitive tasks
- Maintaining balance between different projects

## Current Challenges 🎯

This organization helps me:

- Maintain good academic performance
- Progress efficiently on the company project
- Build solid application files

## Ongoing Lessons 🎓

1. **Planning is essential**: Anticipation reduces stress
2. **Balance is a daily challenge**: Constantly adjusting priorities
3. **Adaptation is crucial**: Staying flexible with unexpected changes
4. **Quality over quantity**: Focusing on what matters
5. **Patience is key**: Rome wasn't built in a day

## Work in Progress 🌟

This journey continues, and I'm constantly refining my approach. I can't wait to share more details about my secret project and Master's search results in future updates!

Meanwhile, I hope these organization strategies can inspire you in your own challenges. Stay tuned for the revelation of my secret project... 😉
